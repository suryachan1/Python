#abstraction  abc=abstract base class import
#before abstract method use '@abstract method' indicate after the method is abstract method
#in abstraction only fn can access the data 
'''ques)create a class ticket which will be the abstract class inside that create a fn bookticket which will be the abstract method and as nothing in it.
